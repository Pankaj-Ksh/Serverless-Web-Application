# üåç AWS Route 53 Setup ‚Äî CodeFusion Serverless Web Application

This document explains the **Amazon Route 53 configuration** for connecting the **CodeFusion CloudFront distribution** to the **custom domain `codefusion.pankajksh.xyz`**.  
Route 53 provides **DNS management**, ensuring reliable routing of web traffic from the domain registrar (GoDaddy) to the CloudFront CDN endpoint.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

| Domain | Record Type | Alias Target | Status | Purpose |
|----------|--------------|----------------|----------|----------|
| `codefusion.pankajksh.xyz` | A (Alias) | CloudFront Distribution (`CodeFusion-CD`) | ‚úÖ In Sync | Routes traffic from domain to CloudFront-hosted frontend |

### 1. Domain Name Servers at Registrar üóÑÔ∏è  
Screenshot from **GoDaddy** (domain registrar) showing **custom nameservers** configured for the root domain `pankajksh.xyz`.  
These nameservers point to **Amazon Route 53**, delegating DNS management to AWS.

### 2. Route 53 Hosted Zone Records (Initial) üó∫Ô∏è   
In the **Amazon Route 53 console**, the **Hosted Zone** for `pankajksh.xyz` displays the initial default records:
- **NS (Name Server)** record  
- **SOA (Start of Authority)** record  

This forms the foundational DNS setup for the hosted zone.

### 3. Create CloudFront Alias Record ‚û°Ô∏è  
Created a new **A record** in the hosted zone:  
- **Record name:** `codefusion`  
- **Record type:** A (Alias)  
- **Alias target:** Linked to the **CloudFront Distribution (CodeFusion-CD)**  

This connects the subdomain `codefusion.pankajksh.xyz` directly to the CloudFront endpoint.

### 4. DNS Change Status: Pending ‚è≥  
Viewed the **Change Info** status after record creation:  
- **Status:** PENDING  
Indicates that Route 53 has received the update and is propagating it across DNS servers globally.

## üß© Integration Summary

**Amazon Route 53** acts as the **DNS routing layer** that bridges the domain registrar with the **AWS CloudFront distribution**.  
It ensures reliable, secure, and low-latency access to the CodeFusion frontend.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Manage DNS records for the CodeFusion domain  
- Route traffic from `pankajksh.xyz` to CloudFront (`CodeFusion-CD`)  
- Enable secure HTTPS delivery using ACM certificates  
- Maintain fault-tolerant and globally distributed DNS resolution
